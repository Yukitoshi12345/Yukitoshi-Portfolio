## Objectives
The following criteria has to be met:

- When loading the employee's portfolio, I should present my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
- Clicking on any of the navigation links should scroll the UI to the corresponding section.
- When you click on the link to the section about my work, the UI should scroll to a section with titled images of the developer's applications. 
- The first application presented should have a larger image than the others.
- Clicking on the images of the applications should take you to that deployed application.
- The layout should adapt responsively to my viewport.

## Work
There are 3 projects I have assisted in creating a website, which are Sydney University Data Society (SUDATA), Sydney University Mathematics Society (SUMS), and the University of Sydney Quidditch Society (USQC). As for SUMS, I have created the website using SiteGround. As for USQC, I have created 80% of it using SquareSpace. For SUDATA, I have only helped a bit as I was lacking knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript at that time. I will be creating a website for the Sydney University Cyber Security Society which is a new society using HTML, CSS, and Javascript! The criteria of clicking image to my deployed application has met for USQC and SUMS.
