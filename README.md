## Objectives
The following criteria has to be met:

- When loading the employee's portfolio, I should present my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
- Clicking on any of the navigation links should scroll the UI to the corresponding section.
- When you click on the link to the section about my work, the UI should scroll to a section with tilted images of the developer's applications. 
- The first application presented should have a larger image than the others.
- Clicking on the images of the applications should take you to that deployed application.
